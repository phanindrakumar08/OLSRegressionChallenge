Cancer Mortality Rate Prediction (US Counties) 🏥📊
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict cancer mortality rates (TARGET_deathRate) for US counties using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The dataset aggregates information from multiple sources, including:

American Community Survey (census.gov)
clinicaltrials.gov
cancer.gov
The goal is to build an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model that provides insights into the key factors influencing cancer mortality rates across different regions.

🛠 Methodology
1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
Examined data distributions and summary statistics.
Identified missing values and potential outliers.
Analyzed feature correlations with TARGET_deathRate.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering 🔍
Handled missing values using imputation techniques.
Encoded categorical variables (if applicable).
Transformed skewed features to improve model performance.
Identified and removed outliers where necessary.
Checked for multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
3️⃣ Model Development 🏗
Built a Multiple Linear Regression (OLS) model.
Selected the best features using backward elimination and statistical significance tests.
Evaluated the model using Adjusted R² and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
4️⃣ Model Diagnostics & Evaluation 📉
Linearity check: Ensured linear relationships between features and the target variable.
Independence of errors: Used Durbin-Watson test for serial correlation.
Heteroskedasticity assessment: Applied Breusch-Pagan test to check for variance in errors.
Normality of residuals: Verified using QQ plots and Shapiro-Wilk test.
Multicollinearity check: Used VIF values to detect highly correlated features.

Our model successfully predicts cancer mortality rates with a reasonable level of accuracy. Further improvements can be made by incorporating additional features or using more complex models like Random Forest Regression or Gradient Boosting.
